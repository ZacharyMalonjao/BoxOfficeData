## Introduction

Entertainment has been one of the most booming industries ever since the invention of the camera and motion picture and has enthralled our hearts through story telling, but have you ever wondered what makes audiences captivated by a film? 


The purpose of the data story is to identify trends of popular and profitable movies and see how genre, language and country of production affect the success of a film, as well as show the overall outlook of genres that continually succeed and compare the changes of people’s taste throughout the years.


We plan on diving in this topic by asking three questions, 
1. Do people still watch movies?
2. Where do they create and consume those movies?
3. What makes a film successful?
## Target Audience

There are 2 primary audiences for this, The first group are consumers — cinephiles and film researchers who use box office data for research, hobbies, or essays. They seek to understand box office trends and uncover the stories behind the films they love.


Next are for the creators, which include producers and those who wish to see the trends to take into consideration when making a new film and where they should make it. It is important to identify the popularity of specific media archetypes when diving into the industry.
## Data Visualization Techniques
I used 6 chart types overall and implemented a blue color scheme, taking color-blind accessibility into consideration and implemented them throughout the dashboard for a uniform formatting. We refrained using it in one graph to display the differences of the items clearly, to be explained further later.
	
I used bar charts to compare the sales of different categories, like by movie or genre.
Line graphs were used to show the trend of a metric, namely sales throughout the years.
A scatter plot was used to compare film ratings visually, 
A treemap was shown to compare a metric, or language in this case, to compare many quantities of a category.
A pie chart was also used  to compare the separation of global and domestic sales compared to the worldwide sales
Lastly a heatmap of the world was used to show the geographical locations found in the dataset so viewers can see the global scope of our data.


## Conclusion
Movies are still very important and people still watch them, but the general audience has not watched as much since the pandemic. The Box Office industry has yet to return to the same level it did post pandemic.
Popular Movies are in English and a lot of them are produced in the US, however their ratings are mixed and most of the revenue still comes from foreign box offices.
Top movies are in the genre of Action, Drama, Comedy, Adventure and Animation. The least popular genres are Mystery, War, Music, Documentary and Romance.


Overall Insight: When making a movie, take into consideration that the box office hasn’t recovered completely yet from the pandemic,so you have 2 choices, either stick to the tried and tested genres of Action, Drama, Comedy, Adventure and Animation to play it safe, or experiment by doing unpopular genres but do it with better writing because low competition provides a stronger niche appeal. Also, whilst most films are developed by the US, keep in mind that most of your viewers are coming from overseas so make a film that will cater to all audiences globally, invest in subtitles/dubbing and international marketing .


For viewers, if you want to make the most of your money and not get disappointed by a film, follow the popular genres mentioned. If you want to be adventurous, explore niche genres to contribute to the diversification of the box office, as well as encourage more people to return to the theaters if you wish to see the box office return to its trajectory before the pandemic.
